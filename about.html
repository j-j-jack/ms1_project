                                    In 2010 Richie Mulligan quit his job as a truck driver to open up a coffee and
                                    confectionary van called "Fast cakes".
                                    Along with his enthusiasm for good coffee, baking had been a long-time passion of
                                    his. So he sold his own cakes and creations
                                    on board the van. In 2014, encouraged by the popularity of his cupcakes in
                                    particular, he decided to open up Late night cakes -
                                    an all night cafe and bulk cupcake producer. Richie operated Speed cakes solo. Now,
                                    Late night cakes has 25 employees
                                    who work through the night to brighten up your day!

                                    We produce custom cupcakes in bulk for whatever your function might be - from
                                    birthday parties to apocalypse parties!
                                    We bake through the night ready for pickup the following morning. This means that
                                    what you get is as fresh as it can
                                    possibly be. The cafe is opening from 9-10am daily for those who wish to taste some
                                    of the multitude of cupcakes we bake every night -
                                    before making an order for your special occasion. We also run an all-night cafe. As
                                    a former lorry driver, Richie still holds a place
                                    in his heart for those still on the road. The cafe runs from 9pm to 7am and is a
                                    great place to sit down and chat with other
                                    drivers while savouring a cup of fine coffee and some of the delicious cakes.

                        In 2010 Richie Mulligan quit his job as a truck driver to open up a coffee and confectionary van
                        called "Fast cakes".
                        Along with his enthusiasm for good coffee, baking had been a long-time passion of his. So he
                        sold his own cakes and creations
                        on board the van. In 2014, encouraged by the popularity of his cupcakes in particular, he
                        decided to open up Late night cakes -
                        an all night cafe and bulk cupcake producer. Richie operated Speed cakes solo. Now, Late night
                        cakes has 25 employees
                        who work through the night to brighten up your day!

                            parties to apocalypse parties!
                            We bake through the night ready for pickup the following morning. This means that what you
                            get is as fresh as it can
                            possibly be. The cafe is opening from 9-10am daily for those who wish to taste some of the
                            multitude of cupcakes we bake every night -
                            before making an order for your special occasion. We also run an all-night cafe. As a former
                            lorry driver, Richie still holds a place
                            in his heart for those still on the road. The cafe runs from 9pm to 7am and is a great place
                            to sit down and chat with other
                            drivers while savouring a cup of fine coffee and some of the delicious cakes.
